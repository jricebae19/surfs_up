Week 9 - SQLite and Jupyter

## Overview of the analysis
We have been tasked by W. Avy to analyze temperature trends before the opening of a surf shop in Oahu. The months for the temperature data we are asked to look over are June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop we are trying to open will be sustainable year-round.
